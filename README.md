## Error correction model
vector error correction model (VECM) is a restricted VAR designed for use with nonstationary series that are known to be cointegrated
cointegration relations built into the specification so that it restricts the long-run behavior of the endogenous variables to converge to their cointegrating relationships while allowing for short-run adjustment dynamics cointegration term is known as the error correction term since the deviation from long-run equilibrium is corrected gradually through a series of partial short-run adjustments.
Our series have nonzero means and deterministic trends as well as stochastic trends
